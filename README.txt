This is an original work project for the image processing course done by:
Batoul Diab

Download the dataset used in project from the bellow link:
https://www.csc.kth.se/~heydarma/Datasets.html
(it will only work with it, or the project must be editted)

About The Graphic User Interface:

In the GUI developed for the project, there are two options for user to use:


1- Single Image Prediction using CBIR:

	a- User chooses the image (with the "Browse Image" button). The image is displayed in the GproceUI.
	b- User chooses the database folder used for the prediction (with the "select database folder" button).
	c- User presses the "Find Simimlar Images" button and waits for the resuling most 9 similar images to appear, and the animal name prediction.

	please consider that using the "animal_database" folder supplied in class, and choosing an image from the dataset, 
	will take about 2-3 minutes to show the result. Please wait for it and don't get bored :)



2- Run The testing Process:
	
	a- User Presses The "Run The Testing Data" button.
	b- User Chooses The Testing Data Folder as prompted.
	   (You can choose any images from the training set and put them together in a single folder, but NEVER remove them from the Training folder)
	c- User Chooses The Training Data Folder as prompted.

	Finding the resulted accuracy for the corresponding Testing and Training data will be 
	done after several hours. 
	The user CAN SEE THE PROGRESS in the Command Window of the matlab.
	When progress reaches 100%, the accuracy result will be displayed.


PLEASE Consider That Everything works properly, any large delay of time is a matter of processing time.
